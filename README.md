# Work in progress:
- Add option to select course by search

# Things to add:
- Make rendering way more robust
  - Ability to resize/scale the canvas
- Option to choose number of levels in graph from chosen node.
- Study line colors on website.
  - Should be clickable and filter by study line.
- Long names should break to stay on screen
- Add coloring by course type in relation to selected study program
  - May require more scraping from individual study program sites
- regarding scrolling/zooming
  - Let zoom by scrolling follow the mouse position (seems difficult)
  - Fix zoom to panned center (also difficult)
  - Utilize scrolling event more cleverly (horizontal scrolling is a thing)

# TODO:
- Make DataCleaner compatible with english titles.
- Find a way to scrape english titles of BSc and Diplom programmes...
- Convert DataCleaner and CourseViewer to .py files and use ArgParser
